/// <summary>
/// Enum indicating how and option behaves during the build process.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Conceptually, Workbench deals with Options that are its building blocks and
/// configure some aspect of a project dynamically. That aspect of the project
/// is referred to as a «feature».
/// 
/// When building, there are a few scenarios, how an option and its feature are
/// compiled:
/// * Both are included: The build includes both the Workbench Option as well
///   as its associated feature. The Option allows to configure the feature at
///   runtime.
/// * Only the feature is included: The Option only configures the feature in
///   the editor. At build-time the Option statically configures the feature
///   in the build and is itself not included. The feature cannot be configured
///   at runtime using Workbench.
/// * Both are removed: Neither the Option nor its feature are included in the
///   build and if set up correctly, the build won't contain a trace that the
///   Option or feature ever existed.
/// 
/// As an example, assume there's a platform integration that requires an API key.
/// The feature is the integration script and maybe some conditionally-compiled
/// snippets of code in other scripts. The Option controls the conditional compilation,
/// injects the integration script when enabled and configures the API key.
/// 
/// When building for another platform, the integration should be completely 
/// removed, leaving no unrelated code in the build. When doing a release build,
/// the API key should be baked into the build, the Option removed and no way
/// left to change the API key at runtime. In a development build, the Option
/// might be included, to be able to override the API key to one used for testing.
/// 
/// In this scenario, different build profiles would configure the build differently:
/// Profiles for other platforms would completely remove the build and feature,
/// the release build profile would only remove the Option and the development
/// profile would include both Option and feature.
